commented bookmarks


the hamburger button is covering the "Home" 
i want the button to be the user dp instaed, it dissapers when hamburger is open and the name of the app shouldnt be inside the hamburger
update the UI on bigger screen for the like commentsb and co button(stretch out)
the UI for all pages shuld be changed too to correlate with the feed pages, plus login and register(remove their hamburger tho)
continue with direct message and comments UI, notifications real time update, post detail pages
also implement the profile such that i can see all my posts
other users can visit another users profile too 
implement a follow function
the navbar is covering bottom of poages on mobile, fix that
the post category buttons should be fixed
for anonymous posts, you dont need to repeat "anonymous", also 
put post time down and stop using 1day 1hour or anything like that, use either 1d, 2d or 3d, when its past 3d, just use date and the time posted(implement accross everywhere time-related/post)
but when i go to the post details, i should be able to see all about the post
i should be able to edit my posts
i should be able to directly view pictures from posts
posts with more that 4pictures should show a 4 image grid and like a + on the last picture to view all, for 3 make the grid make sense too, first picture on one side second and third on a split side(top and bottom) and they should fit to space



the 2 grid images and 1 image is too short make them heighter

post_detail_view wasnt created
reduce the feed on desktop width by 10% padding on both sides and adjust single and double images to show full height but fill spaces in case of different heights, i should be able to post only media and/or post without category, and i should be able to post videos and images together in one post, implement thread, comment photos and videos, comment posts
toggle follow view,public profile view, edit, delete post view
move the category bar to cover teh space between the header and it 


work on each pages UI
i want to be able to go to a persons profile by clicking their dp or name, my profile should look like a public profile too, comments are still not working, i still cant post images and vidoes, add like a plus button to add images or videos after and before one has been selected
still cant post only images or only videos, add a way to accaess and edit my posts, the UI padding for mobile was changed cange back to normal, the grid is too long there
